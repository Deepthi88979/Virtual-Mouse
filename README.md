# Virtual-Mouse
Virtual Mouse â€” control your cursor with hand gestures 
The Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures and Voice Commands. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All i/o operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures along with a voice assistant. This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures and voice commands, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirement. 
The ai is launched using voice command the ai assistant name is proton. 
After ai is launched the the virtual mouse is launched using proton using command " proton launch virtual mouse gesture controller". After launching it uses camera to see our hand actions it has some trained controller actions.
 It sees our hand actions to control as mouse .
